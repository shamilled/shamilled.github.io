My name is Kathryn Brewer and I am an Undergrad Research Assistant to Dr. Laubenbacher.  This website will be used as a form of research so that Dr. Laubenbacher and I may have the opportunity to learn more from the Kids' Tech University students.  This website will be updated regularly to compensate for the ever growing mind of the students as they interact in activities presented on this website, submit questions with reference to the lectures, and submit designs by using the “fractal maker” and “the game of life" programs found throughout the site.  Every email submission will be carefully reviewed by me [The Top Patterns Investigator], in order to maintain a safe and progressive learning environment.<br /><br />

Certain submissions that do not meet the strict criteria will not be posted on the website for other KTU students to see.  So, if you (as a student) do not see your image/question/answer posted on the website, it is not a discrimination against you nor should you feel that your submitted material was not considered “good,” it merely did not meet the strict guidelines for posting.<br /><br />

Another aspect with regards to emailed submissions, the only information that will be made available to the email recipient will be the email address of the sender who is sending the print screen shot of the ‘most beautiful fractal.’  This will be emailed directly to the "Top Patterns Investigator," Kathryn Brewer (Me :D).  With regards to our webmaster, Kris, posting the images/questions/answers on the website, no personal information will be included with the post.  The only information that will be included is a first name of some sorts.  If a first name is not given, it will be stated that the poster was anonymous. (for example: “fractal image posted by anonymous”)<br /><br />
 
 Also, this website has "Google Analytics" in place to observe the number of people that access the website daily, and will monitor how long users stay on the site.  This is intended for data collection to further our research.  With this data, we here at VBI (being investigators ourselves) will be able to confirm that the website's content is capable of holding the interest of the student visitors. <br /><br />

This section of the website will act as an informed consent, for a log-in system was not accepted for the beginning of this research project.  A log-in system may be enforced later on during the progression of this website, which will be announced on the regularly updated calendar.  [the log-in system will not be discussed until this website has been in effect for a year.]<br /><br />

The main goal of this website is to educate and provide a constantly updated system for students to interact with.  This research will lead to an interactive website where students will be learning college level concepts in a fun and entertaining way, which will stimulate their desire to learn.  We hope that with this website we will have the ability to capture students' interest in education and research, while they are still in the state where they love math and science.  That way we can continue to make it interesting while they are still engaged.<br />
<br />

If you have any further questions, please email me at <a href="mailto:kbrewer@vbi.vt.edu" target="_blank"><span class="style6">kbrewer@vbi.vt.edu</span></a>.<br /><br />

<span class="style6">Math Rocks!</span><br /><br />

Sincerely, <br /><br />

Kathryn Brewer<br />
Undergraduate Research Assistant<br />
Mathematics Education<br />
