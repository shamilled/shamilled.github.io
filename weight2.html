			<h3><span class="keyWord">Mass</span> is the quantity of matter in an object.</h3>
			
			<p>All you need is matter to have <b>mass</b>.</p>
			<p>Your mass is the same here on earth as it is on the moon or anywhere else in space.</p>

		<div id="weightDiv">
			<h3><span class="keyWord">Weight</span> is a combination of mass and gravity working together.</h3>
				
			<p><b>Weight</b> is the downward force of an object due to gravity.</p>
			<p>You weigh more on earth than you would on the moon because the moon has less gravity.</p>
			<p>Free falling objects are <b>weightless</b> but still have the same <b>mass</b>.</p>

			<ul>
				<p><b>Have you ever heard of astronauts experiencing <span class="keyWord">Weightlessness</span> when they are in space?</b></p>
				<li>Astronauts don't feel weight in space because they don't feel gravity while they are in space.</li>
				<br>
				<li><b><em>HOWEVER</em></b>, they still have the same <span class="keyWord">Mass</span> in space as they do on earth. Astronauts are not <em>massless</em> in space.</li>
