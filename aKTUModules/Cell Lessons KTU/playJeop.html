		<h1> Thank you for studying cells with us! </h1>
		<p class="welcPar">You have now finished the Cell Module, by Kids' Tech University. From here you can exit back to the KTU Website or join
		us in a game of <b><em>Cell Jeopardy!</em></b> There are two versions of this game. One is for a more in depth study 
		of this module and it is called Full Jeopardy. The other is for a brief review of the module called Quick Jeopardy.
		You can choose either game to play, or you don't have to play at all. Thank you for studying cells with us!</p>
