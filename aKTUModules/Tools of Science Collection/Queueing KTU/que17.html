		<h1>Queueing Theory in Cells</h1>
		
		
		<ul>
			<p style="position: relative; left: -30px;">The goal of Queueing Theory is to better understand resource management and how to be <em>energy efficient</em>. <b>Why do you think 
			it would be important for cells to be energy efficient?</b></p>
			<li><b>Problem</b>: Cells have a limited number of resources and energy but have many jobs that they must complete in order to stay alive.
			To reduce the "costs" in a cell, the cell has to find the best way to do jobs that require a lot of energy.</li>
			<br>
			<li><b>Solution</b>: Just like in our grocery store experiment, cells have to complete as many jobs as possible by using the right 
			number of resources. Cells must manage their resources so that they are not wasting energy.</li>
