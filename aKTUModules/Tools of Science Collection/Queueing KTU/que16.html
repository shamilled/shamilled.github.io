		<ul>
			<li>Is there a better way to line people up at the registers?</li>
			<br>
			<li>If we call the store <em>overloaded</em> when we have too many customers to serve, what do we 
			call the store when we have too few customers for our cashiers?</li>
			<br>
			<li>When you originally calculated that you needed 3 cashiers, you were assuming that your store would always be 
			<em>critically loaded</em>. What do you think <em><span class="keyWord">Critically Loaded</span></em> means?</li>
			<br>
			<li>What could you do as the manager to help out your cashiers in an <em>overloaded</em> situation? What would you do
			when they are <em>underloaded</em>?</li>
