		<p style="width: 880px; font-size: 23px;"><b>The number of customers leaving went down as we increased the number of cashiers.</b></p>
		
		<p>More cashiers meant that your store was able to handle more customers without the lines backing up too much.</p>

		<p>This kept customers from leaving and taking their business elsewhere.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, your store made more money by hiring more staff.</p>
