		<h1>Analyze the Data</h1>
		
		<p style="width: 880px;"><b>You found in your experiment that having <span id="cashNum"></span> cashiers had the highest profit. Your guess was <span id="guessNum"></span> cashiers.
		<span id="guessResp1" style="display: none;">Your guess was right on! </span><span id="guessResp2" style="display: none;">Your guess was really close!</span></b></p>
		
		<p>Do these results surprise you?</p>
		<p>How did hiring more cashiers help you to make more money?</p>
		<p>Look at the number of customers that left for each number of cashier that you had. How does this change as you hire more cashiers?</p>
		<br>
		<p>This is an example of Queueing Theory, which is the study of how lines move. According to Queueing Theory you need a few more cashiers than what you expect from the 
		averages to make sure that lines don't build up and you can serve customers quickly and efficiently.</p>
