		<h1>Conclusion 1</h1>
		
		<p style="width: 880px;"><b>There are quite a lot of things that we can learn about this simple experiment.</b></p>
		
		<p>One of the first things we discovered is that having enough cashiers to handle the average customer flow is not enough to always be able to avoid 
		random line backups that lead to customers leaving.</p>
		<p>The solution was to hire a few more cashiers than we calculated we would need.  This is so we can handle the times that our store is <em>overloaded</em>.</p>
		<p><em>Overloaded</em> means we have more customers than we can handle.</p>
