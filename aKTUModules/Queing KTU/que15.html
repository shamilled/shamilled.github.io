		<h1>Conclusion 2</h1>
		
		<p style="width: 880px; font-size: 23px;"><b>The number of customers leaving went down as we increased the number of cashiers.</b></p>
		
		<p>More cashiers meant that your store was able to handle more customers without the lines backing up too much.</p>
		<p>However, you saw that even when you had 9 cashiers there were times when customers would leave.</p>
		<p>This is because it is difficult to avoid <em>overloading</em> of your cashiers during the rushes.</p>
