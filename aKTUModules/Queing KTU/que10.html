		<h1>Conclusion</h1>
		
		<p style="width: 800px;"><b>We are going to need more cashiers if we want to avoid line build ups.</b></p>

		<p>We saw that 3 cashiers just wasn't enough during rush times. So how many cashiers should we hire? </p>

		<p>It is difficult to predict since this involves the random arrival of people and random delays at the counters. We will have to try several different 
		numbers of cashiers and see which works best.</p>
