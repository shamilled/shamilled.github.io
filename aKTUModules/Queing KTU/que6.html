		<h1>Hypothesis</h1>
		
		<p style="width: 800px;"><b>In your research, you studied traffic at your store and found that 15 people came into your store per hour. You also 
		found out that one cashier can serve 5 people per hour.</b></p>

		<p>You form the following <span class="keyWord">Hypothesis</span>: <em><b><u>If</u> I hire enough cashiers to check out 15 people per hour <u>then</u> the lines in my store will not back up 
		<u>because</u> I will have just enough cashiers to balance the demand of the customers.</b></em></p>

		<p>So 3 cashiers should be the right amount to hire for the store.</p>
