	<ul>
		<li><b>Atom:</b> The smallest unit of an element that contains all the characteristics of that element. Atoms are the building blocks of matter.</li>
		<li><b>Atomic Number:</b> The number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of a specific element. This determines which element the atom is.</li>
		<li><b>Base-Pair (DNA):</b> Complementary pair of nucleotide bases. Of the four bases (A,C,T,G) only A's pair with T's and C's with G's. These pairings are bits of information (similar to the bits - 0's and 1's - used in your computer).</li>
		<li><b>Cancellous Tissue:</b> Spongy tissue inside of the compact tissue of the bone.</li>
		<li><b>Cell:</b> Contain the foundational molecules of life and make up all living things. Contains organelles and can perform specialized tasks.</li>
		<li><b>Cell Membrane:</b> The membrane surrounding the cytoplasm of a cell; consists of a single phospholipid bilayer with embedded proteins.</li>
		<li><b>Chromosome:</b> Part of the cell that carries all of the genetic (hereditary) information in the form of genes.</li>
		<li><b>Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance:</b> The theory stating that hereditary traits are carried on through chromosomes.</li>
		<li><b>Compact Tissue:</b> The tissue used to make the hard outer-layer of the bone.</li>
		<li><b>Cytoplasm:</b>The gel-like material within a cell that provides nutrients and support for the organelles and the cell.</li>
		<li><b>DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid):</b> The genetic material of all organisms; composed of base-pairs wound in a double helix.</li>
		<li><b>Electron:</b> Subatomic particle with a negative charge. Orbits the nucleus of an atom and creates a “cloud” of electrons. Electrons are much smaller than protons and neutrons.</li>
		<li><b>Electron Microscope:</b> Type of microscope that is able to resolve images up to a thousand times better than a light (optical) microscope.</li>
		<li><b>Element:</b> The fundamental materials of which all matter is composed. Elements cannot be broken down into a simpler substance by normal chemical processes.</li>
		<li><b>Enzyme:</b> A protein that is capable of speeding up specific chemical reactions by lowering the required activation energy.</li>
		<li><b>Extracellular Matrix:</b> Network between cells that allows intercellular communication, provides support, and segregates tissues.</li>
		<li><b>Fat Cell/Adipose Tissue:</b> A type of connective tissue that helps the body store energy in fat globules. Fat cells also regulate the body’s temperature by surrounding organs and muscles (acting as a type of insulation).</li>
		<li><b>Golgi Apparatus:</b> A membrane bound organelle composed of stacks of flattened membrane sacs. The Golgi Apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages proteins and lipids (fats) that are then sent off to different parts of the cell.</li>
		<li><b>Lysosome:</b> Organelle made of sacs that contain digestive enzymes. These sacs help break down old organelles and other substances in the cell, keeping the cell “clean”.</li>
		<li><b>Microscope:</b> Tools used to view objects much too small to see with just the eyes. Microscopes have become a staple in modern science. </li>
		<li><b>Mitochondria:</b> Organelle known as the “powerplant” of the cell. Generates energy for the cell from glucose (sugar). </li>
		<li><b>Molecule:</b> Groups of atoms held together with a chemical bond (a connection where atoms share electrons).</li>
		<li><b>Nerve Cell/Neuron:</b> A nerve cell specialized for signal transmission; includes cell body, dendrites, and axon.</li>
		<li><b>Neutron:</b> Subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom that has a neutral charge (no charge).</li>
		<li><b>Nucleolus:</b> In eukaryotes, the site of rRNA synthesis; a spherical body composed chiefly of rRNA in the process of being transcribed from multiple copies of rRNA genes.</li>
		<li><b>Nucleus (Atoms):</b> The central core of the atom containing positively charged protons and electrically neutral neutrons</li>
		<li><b>Nucleus (Cells):</b> The membranous organelle that houses the chromosomal DNA.</li>
		<li><b>Optical Microscope:</b> Type of microscope that uses visible light and allows the viewer to focus on microscopic objects that can be as small the size of a wavelength of light (approx. 550nm)</li>
		<li><b>Organ:</b> A body structure composed of several different tissues grouped in a structural and functional unit.</li>
		<li><b>Organelle:</b> Specialized part of a cell that has a function which helps the cell survive or reproduce.</li>
		<li><b>Organ System:</b> A series of organs that perform similar jobs and work together to accomplish a specific task in the body.</li>
		<li><b>Plasma Cells:</b> An antibody-producing cell resulting from the multiplication and differentiation of a B lymphocyte that has interacted with an antigen.</li>
		<li><b>Platelets:</b> In mammals, a fragment of a white blood cell that circulates in the blood and functions in the formation of blood clots at sites of injury.</li>
		<li><b>Protein:</b> A chain of amino acids joined by peptide bonds.</li>
		<li><b>Proton:</b> Subatomic particle found in the nucleus of an atom that has a positive charge. The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is also called the Atomic Number. </li>
		<li><b>Red Blood Cell:</b> Most common type of blood cell and the primary means of delivering oxygen to the body tissues through the blood.</li>
		<li><b>Ribosome:</b> The organelle that carries out protein synthesis; the most complicated aggregation of proteins in a cell, also containing three different rRNA molecules.</li>
		<li><b>rRNA:</b> Stands for Ribosomal RNA. Type of molecule found in cells that forms part of a ribosome and helps form proteins.</li>
		<li><b>Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum:</b> System of membranes that have ribosomes attached (giving it its “rough” appearance). The RER synthesizes (builds) secretory proteins, phospholipids and membranes.</li>
		<li><b>Smooth Endoplasmic Reticulum:</b> System of membranes in the Endoplasmic Reticulum that does not contain any ribosomes making it “smooth”. The SER produces lipids (fats) and breaks down toxins in the cell.</li>
		<li><b>Subchondral Tissue:</b> The smooth tissue found at the end of each bone.</li>
		<li><b>Tissue:</b> A group of similar cells organized into a structural and functional unit.</li>
		<li><b>White Blood Cell:</b> Type of cell found in the blood that helps defend the body against infections and diseases. The white blood cells absorb intruders, destroy potential infections and produce antibodies.</li>
